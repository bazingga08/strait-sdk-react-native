# Changelog

## 0.7.0

- Every attributed open now supplies the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B16):
  when `/v1/resolve` (verified short link), `/v1/match` (fingerprint) or
  `/v1/referrer` (Play install) returns `clickId`, it is remembered as
  `strait.lastTap` and sent with conversion events. A reply without one (older
  engine) keeps the 0.6.0 behaviour (short link / fingerprint forget the tap; the
  referrer keeps its parsed tap id).
- New core export: `replyClickId` (conformance vectors v4).

## 0.6.0

- Conversion events carry the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B15): the tap id
  of the last attributed link open (browser hand-off `strait_click`, or the Play
  referrer on a deferred install) is remembered under `strait.lastTap` and sent as
  `clickId` with `trackEvent` for 7 days. A newer short-link or fingerprint open
  forgets it. `trackEvent(name, { clickId })` overrides it.
- New core exports: `eventClickId`, `rememberTap`, `ATTRIBUTION_WINDOW_MS`
  (conformance vectors v3).

## 0.5.0

Renamed to Strait (breaking; clean break, no aliases).

- Package is now `@strait/sdk-react-native`; repo `bazingga08/strait-sdk-react-native`,
  homepage https://usestrait.com.
- API: `createBridge` → `createStrait`, `Bridge` → `Strait`, `BridgeRuntime` →
  `StraitRuntime`, `CreateBridgeConfig` → `CreateStraitConfig`, `BridgeConfig` →
  `StraitConfig`, `parseBridgeLink` → `parseStraitLink`, `parseBridgeClick` →
  `parseStraitClick`.
- Wire params: only `strait_click` (tap id) and `strait_link` (Play referrer) are read.
- Storage keys: `strait.deferredChecked`, `strait.pendingOpens` (old values are ignored,
  so the deferred check runs once more after upgrading).
- Android native module is now `StraitInstallReferrer`.

## 0.4.0

- Every link open is reported exactly once (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B14):
  `LinkEvent.id` is the open id; failed reports are kept under
  `bridge.pendingOpens` and retried (≤7 days, ≤100). New
  `pendingOpenReports()` and `flushOpenReports()`.
- A `bridge_click` tap id is removed from the destination and returned as
  `clickId`.
- The deferred check is marked done only once the engine answered; unreadable
  storage counts as "already checked" and flag write failures never throw.

### Packaging

- Publish-ready: complete package metadata (repository, homepage, bugs, keywords),
  `exports` map with types, `sideEffects: false`, MIT `LICENSE`. Only `dist/`,
  README, LICENSE and this changelog ship (no tests, fixtures or source maps).
- The package name, npm scope and URLs come from `brand.json` (applied by
  `scripts/brand.mjs`), so the brand switch is one command.
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` → GitHub Actions runs the tests and publishes to npm with
  provenance (see PUBLISHING.md). Nothing publishes until `NPM_TOKEN` is set and
  the brand is marked final.

## 0.3.0

- Pure core shared with every SDK (the SDK contract), `onLinkStart` loading
  signal, `normalizeLinkHosts`; app-link listeners isolated per client.

## 0.2.0

- `createBridge` + `onLink`: one event for every way a link opens the app.
- Breaking: `appId` → `publishableKey`.

## 0.1.0

- Deferred match: Android Play Install Referrer + iOS fingerprint.
